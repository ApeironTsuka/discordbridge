maybe have !close work in private channels to leave them
maybe a way to make/join priv channels?

test
  discord (create something similar to overseer-cli for this...)
    whisper handling
      create channel
      message to/from
    priv handling
      create/destroy channel
      message to/from
    !enable/!disable/!close/!keepparty
    party/raid notice
    party/raid status changes
    party/raid join/leave/online/offline messages
    friendlist online/offline/busy messages
  bridge (try to isolate what's possible *outside* of Proxy because that would be significantly easier)
    all the things
