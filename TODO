watch for channel deletion
  complain when in-use channels are deleted
  silently handle whisper deletions as if !close was used

maybe have !close work in private channels to leave them

fork node-emoji and merge a bunch of PRs into it to use instead (since upstream seems abandoned)

maybe a way to make/join priv channels?
  If any of these are actually used... haven't been having good luck with guessing what SMTs are in use
