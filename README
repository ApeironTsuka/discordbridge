How to set up:

Create a folder mods\discordbridge and place module.json in it
Start Proxy
Let it update/install this
If it complains about S_PRIVATE_CHANNEL_NOTICE missing, add the line "S_PRIVATE_CHANNEL_NOTICE = 55697" to node_modules/tera-data/map/protocol.343312.map and hope the id hasn't changed since I last updated this
It will complain that you haven't installed this correctly. That's normal
Exit Proxy
Open Discord proper (web or desktop, not mobile app)
Go to Settings->Appearance and enable Developer Mode
Right-click your name and click Copy ID
Open discordbridge\discord\auth and paste the id on the owner line
Turn Developer Mode back off
Create a new server just for this. Not required by VERY HIGHLY recommended. I cannot stress how recommended it is
Go to discordapp.com
Log in if you aren't already
At the top, hover Developers and click Developer Portal
Click New Application on the right
Name it something
On the left, click the Bot tab
Create a bot
Click "Click To Reveal Token" and copy the token
Open discordbridge\discord\auth and paste the token on the sekrit line
Go to the General Information tab
Copy the client ID
Go to http://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=8&client_id=<paste the client ID here>
Add the bot to the server you created earlier
Open a Command Prompt
cd path\to\wherever\you\have\proxy\installed
cd mods\discordbridge\discord
npm --global install windows-build-tools
npm install he discord.js
Assuming the above went okay, close Command Prompt
Now you can start Proxy back up again
It should work now

Caveats:
It's not multi-client friendly. Only the first connected client will be bridged to Discord. Any others will show the line "Only the first loaded TERA instance can use Discord". If you exit every client and then start a new one (so that it's the only running one at that moment), it will be the one bridged. I can't think of a good way to bridge multi-client in a sane way that doesn't require several Discord bot instances to match and yeah, too much work.
