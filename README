How to set up:

Discord side:
  Open Notepad
  Open Discord proper (web or desktop, NOT mobile app)
  Go to Settings->Appearance and enable Developer Mode
  Right-click your name in a chat somewhere
  At the bottom, click Copy ID, and paste it onto Notepad
  Turn Developer Mode back off
  Create a new Discord server just for this. Not required but VERY HIGHLY recommended. I cannot stress how recommended it is
  Go to http://discordapp.com
  Log in if you aren't already
  At the top, hover over Developers and click Developer Portal
  Click the New Application button on the right
  Name it something. Doesn't matter what.
  On the left, click the Bot tab
  Create a bot using the Add Bot botton on the right
  Click "Click To Reveal Token" and copy the token to Notepad
  Go to the General Information tab on the left
  Under Client ID, click the Copy button
  Copy this link http://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=8&client_id= and paste client ID at the end, then go to it
  Add the bot to the server you created earlier

Toolbox side:
  Create the folder [toolbox]\mods\discordbridge and place module.json in it
  Start Toolbox
  Let it install/update this
  Open a Command Prompt and enter the following commands, in order. Replace [toolbox] with wherever it is you have it installed (example C:\Caali Toolbox\mods\discordbridge\discord)
    cd [toolbox]\mods\discordbridge\discord
    npm install
    cd ..
    npm install
  Assuming the above went okay, close Command Prompt
  Open [toolbox]\mods\discordbridge\discord\auth
  Paste the token and your client ID from Notepad into the "" for sekrit and owner
  Start TERA and go to the character select screen
  If it complains about the following...
     ... Discord.js not found, make sure the Command Prompt steps above were done correctly
     ... missing owner or token in discord/auth, make sure you editted that file as stated above
     ... anything else, report it to me or the github 
  You should see the following lines (maybe):
    [discord] Logging in..
    [discord] connected 0
    [discord] Loading bot id 0
    [discord] loaded system
    [discord] loaded help
    [discord] Loading bot id <your new server's ID>
    [discord] loaded system
    [discord] loaded help
    [discord] loaded bridge
    [discord] Successfully logged in
  If you don't see the "Loading bot id <your new server's ID>", say something in one of the channels
  Log into a character
  You should start seeing things showing up on Discord
  Use !help on Discord to get a list of available commands
  Use /8 discordbridge [on/off] to turn the bridge on/off
    Note that this setting is not currently saved and only silences the bridge rather than shutting it off entirely

Caveats:
It's not multi-client friendly. Only the first connected client will be bridged to Discord. Any others will show the line "Only the first loaded TERA instance can use Discord". If you exit every client and then start a new one (so that it's the only running one at that moment), it will be the one bridged. I can't think of a good way to bridge multi-client in a sane way that doesn't require several Discord bot instances to match and yeah, too much work.
